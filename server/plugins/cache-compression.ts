/**
 * Remounts the `cache` storage with a compression wrapper around whatever
 * driver is configured (Redis in deployed envs, memory in dev) — every cached
 * value (SSR page HTML, cached data responses) is compressed on write and
 * decompressed on read. See server/utils/cacheCompression.ts for the codec
 * choice and storage format, and why old uncompressed entries keep working.
 *
 * This runs at plugin-init time, before any request traffic, so nothing ever
 * observes the unwrapped driver.
